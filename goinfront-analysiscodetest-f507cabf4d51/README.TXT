1. Bollinger bands
Bollinger bands consists of three plot-lines, a 20 day (or other period, but we use 20 day in this test) moving average as the center band, and an upper and lower band
two standard deviations above and below the center band. Bollinger bands are typically plotted together with the original data.

2. The relative strength index.
The RSI is an indicator that measures the speed and change of price movements. RSI is typically plotted below the original data on a separate y-axis.
